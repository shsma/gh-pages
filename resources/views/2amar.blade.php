<h4>
    Take another walk out of your fake world
    Please put all the drugs out of your hand
    You'll see that you can breath without no back up
    So much stuff you got to understand
</h4>

        <h2>For any step in any walk, any town of any thought...I'll be you guide...</h2>
        <h2>For every street of any scene...Any place you've never been...I'll be your guide</h2>
<br>
<h4>
    You know there's still a place for people like us
    The same blood runs in every hand
    You see it's not the wings that make the angel
    Just have to move the bats out of your head
</h4>
<br>
        <h2>Easy as a kiss we'll find an answer...</h2>
<br>
<h4>
    Put all your fears back in the shade
    Don't become a ghost without no colour
</h4>
<br>
        <h2>You're the best paint life ever made...</h2>
